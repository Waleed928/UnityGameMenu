# Automated-Environment-Generator
### Overview
Unity game engine has been used for autonomous vehicle simulation software these days. However, testing autonomous vehicles requires diverse environments, which include different road types, different vehicles, different environmental settings, different types of pedestrians, etc. All these environments are currently being created manually. In this project, the major goal is to create such environments automatically. The project group members can simply use various artifacts available in the Unity asset store. They will need to create a UI that offers options based on the assets available, using which the users must be able to specify options of what elements and sizes of maps they want. The program will need to consider these inputs and any additional constraint(s) given by the users and need to generate maps automatically. If time allows, the group is encouraged to add random vehicles which will have a way-point base movement.
